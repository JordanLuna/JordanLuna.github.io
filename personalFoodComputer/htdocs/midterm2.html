                    <h3>Food Security</h3>
                    
                        <p>Being able to grow your own food is gives people an exciting opportunity to test their skills, be productive, and contribute in a positive manner to society as a whole. With less chemicals and less waste, we promote a healthier way of life, not just for people, but for the planet we call home.</p>
                    
                        <p>A quick lesson in migration. What happens when people run out of resources? They move. They move into places other people inhabit. This phenomenon puts strain on the migrated area. People then find resources becoming scarce once again. This is where food security comes in.</p>
                        
                        <p>People fight over resources, like water, land, and of course, food. The personal food computer is a great discovery and the time is right. To use a small amount of space and other precious resources to produce healthful food is one of the greatest hurdles humanity could ever overcome. Our future depends on the ability to become efficient, without being wasteful.</p>

                        <h3>What's the big deal?</h3>
                        <p>The great thing about this system is more what it doesn't have than what it has. It doesn't use dirt or soil, it doesn't need sun, and it needs no extra equipment to be installed to a home or business. The food computer plugs into existing water and electricity in any building. It uses shallow water culture and <span class="tooltip">raft hydroponics<span class="tooltiptext">Raft hydroponics is a method of spacing between plants in a garden.</span></span> to spray the plant's airborne roots instead of saturating soil.</p>
                    
                        <p>According to <a href="http://www.aeroponics.com/aero6.htm" target="_blank">aeroponics.com</a>, soilless gardening can:</p>

                            <li>Reduce fertilizer usage by 95%</li>
                            <li>Reduce pesticide usage by 99%</li>
                            <li>Increase crop yields by 45% to 75%</li>
                            <li>Grow in area not previously tillable</li>
                            <li>No dirt required</li>

                    <h3>What is an airborne root system?</h3>
                        <p>Airborne root systems are aptly named in that they grow in the air! They are able to do this because the roots absorb nutrients from a mist. There are an array of sensors that collect data on the conditions inside the grow case, such as humidity, carbon dioxide levels, light intensity and pH. The computer then identifies the optimal conditions for the plant, then adjusts and administers a mist with everything the plant needs.</p>
                    
                        <p>Using technology like this to optimize the resources necessary to grow food helps eliminate waste and fine tunes climate control. Since the garden is enclosed, the exposure to pests is also limited, so pesticides are virtually unnecessary.</p>

                        <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/06/17/inside-an-mit-researchers-grand-plan-to-create-the-personal-food-computer/">Washington Post</a> Caleb Harper, the founder of CityFarm research group, says:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>"[He] imagines climate recipes that would be available free online. Whoever perfects Thai basil will see the recipe move to the top of a ranking system. Suddenly everyone can benefit from the perfect air temperature, pH and blend of nutrients."</p>

                        <p>The technical specifications are published and open to the public. There is code people have published on <a href="https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_brain" target="_blank">github</a> ready to be installed on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberry Pi</a>, as well as other code needed for drivers.

                    <h1>Opensource is Key</h1>
                        <p>In order for this to become a reality, that every home could potential grow part of their own food sources, we must be willing to share the information we glean from these types of socio-economic experiments.</p>
                        <p>One of the cornerstones of this kind of project is that it is opensource. This aspect is too important to overlook. One person, group, or even company can be innovative, but if we do not share what we know, there will be no room to grow.</p>
